DIABETES PROGRESSION PREDICTIONS:

This project focuses on predicting the progression of diabetes in patients over time using machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical and lifestyle data, the model estimates future blood sugar levels to help with early intervention and better disease management.
Key Features:
Utilizes regression algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor for prediction.
Implements thorough data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature scaling.
Performs model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared to assess prediction accuracy.
Provides clear visualizations of data trends and model performance.
Modular Python code organized for ease of understanding and reuse.
Technologies Used:
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Machine Learning Algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
Data Visualization tools
Purpose:
This project aims to assist healthcare professionals and patients by predicting diabetes progression, enabling timely lifestyle adjustments and treatment plans.
